## Mentoring

<br>

#### Early Research Scholar Program (ERSP) at UCSB

I am mentoring an undergraduate team of 4 students of Early Research Scholar Program (ERSP) at UCSB for empirical benchmarking of offline policy learning methods for Reinforcement Learning. For an initial description of this program, see <a href="https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/2020-2021-projects/group-4-20202021">here</a>.
