I am fond of the broad area of machine learning, e.g. reinforcement learning, large scale optimization and statistics. My current research primarily focuses on building statistical foundations for offline reinforcement learning. I enjoy understanding the theoretical ground of different algorithms that are of practical importance. Recently, I start to think about how to appropriately apply deep models to make RL practical. I am on the job market.

The primary goal of the webpage is to share my thoughts and summarize the ideas of my research and some topics I am interested in. Please check the `Blog` page! For the list of papers, go to [Publications](/publications) page.


In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly basketball and soccer), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. Besides, I like listening to classical music and playing piano (just a little bit).
