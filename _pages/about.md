:smiley: I am a PhD student with the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and the [Department of Statistics and Applied Probability](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at UC, Santa Barbara, in the Statistical Machine Learning group, advised by [Dr. Yu-Xiang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yuxiangw/){:target="\_blank"}. I am also co-advised by [Dr. J.S. Rao](http://jammalam.faculty.pstat.ucsb.edu){:target="\_blank"}. I am currently pursuing PhDs in both Departments. Prior to UCSB, I got my B.S. from [Applied Math at 
University of Science and Technology of China](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm){:target="\_blank"}. I have also spent time at Princeton University and Amazon AWS AI Research.

I am fond of the broad area of machine learning, e.g. reinforcement learning, large scale optimization and statistics. My current research primarily focuses on building statistical foundations for offline reinforcement learning. I enjoy understanding the theoretical ground of different algorithms that are of practical importance. Recently, I start to think about how to appropriately apply deep models to make RL practical. I am on the job market.

The primary goal of the webpage is to share my thoughts and summarize the ideas of my research and some topics I am interested in. Please check the `Blog` page! For the list of papers, go to [Publications](/publications) page.


In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly basketball and soccer), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family. Besides, I like listening to classical music and playing piano (just a little bit).
